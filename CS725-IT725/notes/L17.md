# Network Layer
- Wanted to be stateless

## Network Layer & IP
- Layer specific function: Routing
- Common functions
    - Adddressing (IP Addy)
    - Error control (Rerouting, ICMP)
    - Flow control (ICMP)
    - QoS (TOS field, and Differentiated Services)

## Internet Protocol (IP)
- Provides unreliable, connection-less service
- Packets can be
    - Lost
    - Out of order
    - Duplicated
    - Corrupted

### Design goals
- Fields for source and destination
- Means for error control 
    - Detection of packet header corruption (L2 does heavy lifting)
    - Limiting the lifespan of a packet
- Fragmentation, carrying transport layer messages that are longer than what L2 can support

### IPv4 Header
- From the 70s, 50 years old, kinda outdated
- *Check RFC 791 for more info*
- Version
- Protocol
    - ICMP, UDP, TCP, IGMP, IGRP, AH, ESP, GRE, SKIP, EIGRP, OSPF, L2TP
    - Multiplex field
    - Where to send it next in the transport layer
- Fragment Offset
- Fragment Flags
    - x: 0x80, reserved (evil bit)
    - D: 0x40, Do Not Fragment
    - M: 0x20, More Fragments Follow
- Header Length
- Total Length
- Header Checksum
- Time to live
    - 8 bits, 0 - 255
    - Initially some big-ish value
    - Decremented each hop
    - Packet dropped when it reaches zero, ICMP sent back to sender
    - Sounds problematic, but density of links solves this problem
- 1500 bits Maximum length for an internet frame

### Traceroute uses TTL
- Send out packet with 1TTL to xxx.yyy
- Send out packet with 2TTL to xxx.yyy
- ...
- Record each ICMP response that tells you everything
- Can also be used by hacker

### Fragmentation
- Problem: Network layer needs to deliver a PDU that is longer than what the link layer permits
- Solutions:
    - Do nothing (Drop)
    - Drop and inform (IPV6)
    - Fragment, break the pdu into smaller units and reassemble them at the destination (IPv4)
- Allow packet reassembly, need information on where a fragment fits in the original packet
- Be able to distinguish between fragments of different packets
- Be able to further fragment a fragment
    - And be able to reassemble the original packet in one go, not reassembling fragments that are reassembled...
- Composition
    - Identification (16 bits), identifies the original fragmented packet
    - Fragment Offset (13 bits)
        - Specifies the location of the fragment in the packet
        - Only the 13 most significant bits of the 16 bit value stored in the field, the remaining must be 0
        - The other three bits are x (Evil bit, usually 0), D (Do not Fragment), and M (More Fragments after me) for flags.
- Only break packets on 8 bit groups

Example:
We have a packet of length 4,500 bytes, and reach a router with MTU 2,500 bytes:

| Frag | Total Bytes | Header Bytes | Data Bytes | More Frags | Frag Offset (bytes) |
|------|-------------|--------------|------------|------------|---------------------|
| 1    | 2500        | 20           | 2480       | 1          | 0                   |
| 2    | 2040        | 20           | 2020       | 0          | 310                 |

Now we reach another router with a smaller MTU of 1,500 bytes:

| Frag | Total Bytes | Header Bytes | Data Bytes | More Frags | Frag Offset (bytes) |
|------|-------------|--------------|------------|------------|---------------------|
| 1    | 1500        | 20           | 1480       | 1          | 0                   |
| 2    | 1020        | 20           | 1000       | 1          | 180                 |
| 3    | 1500        | 20           | 1480       | 1          | 310                 |
| 4    | 560         | 20           | 540        | 0          | 495                 |

- Note that these have been reassembled and then split up again, so they're all of the same parent, not multiple differnet fragments
- Processing headers is slower, so less packets means less headers to process, so why not have a router that will reassemble the packets into bigger ones if we went from 1500 to 2500 MTU? Because it's work, and routers are stateful

## ICMP
- Internet Control Message Protocol
- Runs on top of IP but still within the network layer
- Examples
    - Ping - Echo request/reply
    - Traceroute - "Time" (Hops) exceeded
    - "No route to host" - Destination unreachable
    - Source Quench (Deprecated by RFCs 1812 and 6633)
- It can be used for discovery, which can be problematic
    - Protection:
        - Unclean - Do not respond to pings (filtered between outside and inside of organization)

# Is a Home Router a Router?
- Radim Says Yes, but also No
- It's also a...
    - Ethernet switch (Internet L2 Switch)
    - WiFi AP
    - IP Router
    - Network Address Translation (NAT)
    - DHCP
    - NAS
    - Print Server
    - DNS Server

## NAT
- Network Address Translation
- Motivation
    - Allow multiple nodes to share a single IP Address
    - Prevent external traffic from entering the local network
- Major Issues
    - Cannot send into the network, only outbound
    - There can be a port number conflict on the WAN side so the port numbers can and do get translated too

## IPv6 - Protocol Design
- Keep the good stuff
    - Unreliable datagram service
    - TTL, TOS (Compatibility)
- Eliminate the unnecessary...
    - No fragmentation (optional)
    - No header checksums
- Address the issues...
    - Longer addresses and more

## Terms
- ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol
- TOS: Type of Service
- PDU: Fancy term for packet
