# Network Layer
- Wanted to be stateless

## Network Layer & IP
- Layer specific function: Routing
- Common functions
 - Adddressing (IP Addy)
 - Error control (Rerouting, ICMP)
 - Flow control (ICMP)
 - QoS (TOS field, and Differentiated Services)

## Internet Protocol (IP)
- Provides unreliable, connection-less service
- Packets can be
 - Lost
 - Out of order
 - Duplicated
 - Corrupted

### Design goals
- Fields for source and destination
- Means for error control 
 - Detection of packet header corruption (L2 does heavy lifting)
 - Limiting the lifespan of a packet
- Fragmentation, carrying transport layer messages that are longer than what L2 can support

### IPv4 Header
- From the 70s, 50 years old, kinda outdated
- *Check RFC 791 for more info*
- Version
- Protocol (ICMP, UDP, TCP, IGMP, IGRP, AH, ESP, GRE, SKIP, EIGRP, OSPF, L2TP)
- Fragment Offset
- IP Flags
 - x: 0x80, reserved (evil bit)
 - D: 0x40, Do Not Fragment
 - M: 0x20, More Fragments Follow
- Header Length
- Total Length
- Header Checksum
- Time to live
 - 8 bits, 0 - 255
 - Initially some big-ish value
 - Decremented each hop
 - Packet dropped when it reaches zero, ICMP sent back to sender
- 1500 bits Maximum length for an internet frame

## Terms
- ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol
- TOS: Type of Service
