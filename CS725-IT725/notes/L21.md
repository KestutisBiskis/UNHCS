# Network Layer

## Categories of Networks
- Compromise: Virtual packet switched
    - Circuit switched
    - Packet switched
        - Problems:
            - No conn between packets
            - Difficult to provide QOS
            - Difficult to provision resources
            - Difficult to control routes the packets take
            - Reactive fault tolerance

- Virtual Circuit switched Networks
    - An overlay on top of a packet switched network that provides a circuit-based service
    - Most of the benefits at a fraction of the cost
    - Trading ability to control for loss of simplicity
- Always the next big thing
    - OSI - Open System Interconnect (RIP)
    - ATM - Asynchronous Transfer Mode (RIP)
    - MPLS - MultiProtocol Lable Switching
