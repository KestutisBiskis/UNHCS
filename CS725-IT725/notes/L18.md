## IPv6

### IPv6 - Motivation
- What's wrong with IPv4?
    - Not enough addresses
    - To complex to process in routers
    - autoconfiguration
    - Security
- Can we avoid switching to IPv6?
    - Network Address Translation (NAT)
    - We'd like to, but we cannot

### IPv6 - Protocol Design
- Keep the good stuff
    - Unreliable datagram service
    - TTL, TOS (for compatibility)
- Eliminate the unnecessary
    - Fragmentation as an option
    - No header checksums
- Address the issues
    - Longer addresses and more

### IPv6 Header
| Offset | Bit  | 0                   | 1               | 2            | 3          |
|--------|------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| Octet  |      | Version             | Traffic Class   | Flow Label   |            |
|   0    |  0   |                     |                 |              |            |
|--------|------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
|   4    | 32   | Payload Length      | Next Header     | Hop Limit    |            |
|--------|------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
|   8    | 64   |                  Source Address (128 bits)                        |
|        |      |                               (16 bytes)                          |
|--------|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  24    | 192  |               Destination Address (128 bits)                      |
|        |      |                               (16 bytes)                          |


### IPv6 Address Representation
- An IPv6 address is represented by 8 groups of 16-bit hexadecimal values separated by colons
- Can be abbreviated
    - Omit leading zeroes in a 16-bit value
    - Replace one group of consecutive zeroes by a double colon
- Example
    - 2606:4100:38c0:0009:0000:0000:0000:0005
    - 2606:4100:38c0:9::5

### Special Use IPv6 Addresses
- ::/128 - Unspecified
- ::1/128 - Loopback
- ::FFFF:0:0/96 - IPv4 mapped
- FE80::/10 - Link-local unicast
- FF00::/8 - Multicast

## Routing
- Approaches
    - First find a path from source to destination and then follow it (Source Routing)
    - Go to first corner, ask for direction to the next corner that is on the way to the destination (From routing tables). Repeat until you reach the destination (Hop-by-Hop Routings)

### Routing Table Content
- Automatically populated with entries based in local L2 Configuration
- Static Entries are added by the network administrator
- Dynamic Entries added as found

### Link Weights
- Reliability
- Bandwidth
- Latency (RTT)
- Cost
- Utilization
- Security

### Link & Path Measures
- Link Measures
    - Throughput / bit rate
    - Latency
    - Loss probability
    - Availability
    - Current load
    - Security
    - Monetary cost
- Path measures
    - Sum
        - Latency
        - Monetary Cost
    - Min/Max
        - Throughput / bit rate
    - Product
        - Loss probability

### Trivial Routing Methods
- Hot potato routing
    - Send to randomly chosen outgoing link
    - Not practical
- Flooding
    - Send a copy to every outgoing link
    - Not practical
- Limited Flooding
    - Every packet has a sequence number (together with the source address, this makes a copy of a packet uniquely identifiable)
    - Send a copy to every other outgoing link
    - Keep track of forwarded packets so that copies are sent only once

### Routing Protocols - Categories
- Link State
    - Exact neighbor information flooded to everyone
    - Topology of the entire networks is discovered in each node
    - Shortest paths calculated and used to populate the routing tables
- Distance Vector
    - Estimates of distances to all nodes in the network sent to all neighbors
    - Estimates are improved based on information from neighbors
    - The process is repeated and routing tables are populated based on the estimates
