# EXAM WEDNESDAY, DONT GO

# Link State (Recap)
- Exact neighbor information flooded to every node on the network
- Topology of the entire network is discovered in each node
- Shortest paths calculated and used to populate the routing tables

## Scalability of Routing Protocols
- Internet is larget
- Need to introduce hierarchy
    - ...into something that does not naturally have one
    - Divide and conquer, abandoning hope for optimality
    - Based on ownership - Autonomous System (AS)
- Different routing problems:
    - Intra AS routing - Interior gateway routing (IGP)
    - Inter AS routing - Exterior gateway routing (EGP)

## RIP
- Routing Information Protocol
    - A distance vector routing protocol
    - Hops used as a measure of distance
    - 30s update interval
- Version history
    - RIPv1 - 1998
    - RIPv2 - 1993 (CIDR, auth)
    - RIPng - 1997 (IPv6)

## OSFP
- Open shortest path first
    - Link state routing protocol
    - Two-level hierarchy
    - User defined link weights
- Version history:
    - OSPF - 1989
    - OSPFv2 - 1998
    - OSPFv3 - 2008 (IPv6)
