# Cloud Management: Load Balancing & Load Management

## Load
- Not all work is created equal
- When interacting with the cloud, some components may need to work harder than others:
    - Smoe tasks are more compute/data intensive
    - Some item/object is more popular "hot" data
- Yet we don't want to be slowed down by one busy component

## Load Balancing & Management
- Load balancing techniques differ for different applications and use cases
    - Data partitioning
    - Workload partitioning "data-parallel" approach
    - "Reshuffling"
        - Move data for a more uniform load -- avoid too many hot objects in one place
        - Move work to avoid processing hot spots to better collocate with data
- Applied at different levels of application/architecture stack
    - Application and or system balancing
    - Cluster management
    - Server level load balancing

## Static and dynamic load balancing
- Static assumes no knowledge about system's performance or health
    - L4 Load balancers (network)
- Dynamic load balancing uses systme's data to adjust for better performance as needed
    - L7 Load balancers (application) (Can be static as well)
