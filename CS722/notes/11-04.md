# Data Processing: Stream Processing

## Problems
- We need to have all the data before we start processing
    - What if data are constantly produced
    - When it changes we often need to reprocess everything
- Batch processing is offline, high latency to see the results

## Stream Processing
- One solution to handling continuously changing data is stream processing
    - Data are streamed -- added for processing as it becomes available
    - Event -- each new datum in the system
    - Need a system to collect events -- streaming service or message/event broker
        - Pub/Sub/Queue
