# High Throughput Replication with Integrated Membership Management
## Chain Paxos for Fun and Throughput
Presented by Christopher Baughman

## Goal
- Minimize communication cost to achieve highest possible throughput
- Three pieces:
    - Write performance: chain replication
    - Read performance: local linearizable reads
    - Integrated membership management

## Leader based paxos
- Leader communicates with each replica
- O(n)

## Chain Paxos
- O(1)
- Fall back to paxos phase 1 when needed
- Send Accept and Accept Ack at same time
- Each replica adds its own Accept Ack
- When Quorum is reached, replica immediately commits
- Ack piggy-back on next message for replicas that missed
